# Destiny 2 Font Symbols
The font icons on this site were from the fonts folder in the Destiny 2 files, and button styles are from the bungie website.
The scanner folder contains a short script to search a font for characters in a certain range (Chrome Only).
The site can be accessed from [this link](https://nathanrsxtn.github.io/Destiny-2-Font-Symbols/) (works best in the Steam overlay).
Clicking on symbols **copies** the symbol. You will have to use the usual keyboard shortcut to paste it into your username or in-game chat (the symbols will only show up in-game).
##### Beyond Light
The Destiny 2 files no longer includes an unpackaged font file. Placeholder text and temporary images from the Bungie API have been added for some of the new symbols. New symbols will not be displayed properly on this site but will still work in-game.
